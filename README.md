# Hacking-The-Kernel

Implementation of Threads, User programs, Virtual memory and File system in educational PintOS.

## Project Introduction
Pintos is a simple instructional operating system framework for the 80Ã—86 architecture. The software supports 
kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very 
simple way. Pintos was created at Stanford University by Ben Pfaff in 2004. Pintos is capable of running on 
actual x86 hardware, though it is often run on top of an x86 emulator, such as Bochs or Qemu.
